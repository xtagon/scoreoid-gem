Scoreoid Ruby
=============

Summary
-------

Scoreoid Ruby is a wrapper for the [Scoreoid][1] API.

Installation
------------

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'scoreoid'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install scoreoid

Usage
-----

Full documentation is [available online][2].

To get started, configure Scoreoid Ruby with your API key and game ID:

    require 'scoreoid'
    
    Scoreoid.configure(api_key: 'YOUR_API_KEY', game_id: 'YOUR_GAME_ID')

Then you can start querying Scoreoid API methods:

    new_players_count = Scoreoid::API.query('countPlayers', start_date: '2009-08-04')
	new_players_count['players'] # => 34

Any Scoreoid API method may be called in this manner. See the [Scoreoid Wiki][3] for information on available API methods.

Future versions of Scoreoid Ruby will provide a more object-oriented manner of querying data. Then it will look more like this:

    Scoreoid::Player.count # => 34
